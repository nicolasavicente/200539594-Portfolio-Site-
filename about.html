                <p>As a new software developer, I am constantly updating my toolkit and adding to my abilities. With a
                    strong will to learn and ability to problem solve, new technologies and challenges are always

                    Having had several past jobs in customer service and retail environments selling products people
                    love, I have developed key soft skills:
                <ul>
                    <li>Listening, finding out what people need and why </li>
                    <li>
                        Communication, explaining technical things such as automotive and some financial concepts (I
                        worked in customer service/sales at a car dealership)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Professionalism, I know that as an employee to a company I represent that company and all of
                        their products and services
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reliability, with years of work under my belt since the age of 16 I learnt the value of showing
                        up and being dependable day in and day out
                    </li>
